  project: Poll app - 2017
  context:
    - Tailored application enabling polls for our internal teams (~150 users).
    - Needs to have live information.
    - Confluence was not user friendly enough for the team and sharing the information.
  role:
    - Company side project as a full stack front end developper.
    - Implementation using react, redux, thunk, google material design as the front-end and firebase as the back-end.
    - Using serverless technology, google cloud functions for live push notifications.
    - CI/CD pipeline is using Travis, Firebase hosting and Codacy for code quality.
  challenge: First attempt to use functional programming, redux pattern in a production environment as well as tackling data serialization and deserialization due to firebase constraints.
  description: The app leverages google api capabilities such as auth, realtime database, cloud functions, cloud messaging to allow users to create interactive polls with live information when it is submitted.<br>
    I had the chance to get mentored by 2 of the most talented DevOps engineers/Developers <a href='https://github.com/mlucchini' target='_blank'>Marc Lucchini</a> & <a href='https://github.com/slyg' target='_blank'>Sylvain Faucherand</a> I have ever met.

    Recruiting participants and running the experimental protocol.<br>
    Qualitative data analysis of feedback, usability measures of more than 120 participants.<br>
    US third party provided patches for one of the device that helps administer electric shocks which were out of date.This caused issues during the experiment and I have identified the problem root cause - wrong patch models for the device.
  description:
    The Philips device in the context of emergency was the most efficient in helping users to admnister electric shocks as well as performing CPR routines.<br>
    The Philips AED had vocal instructions telling the users that <em>"nobody should touch the patient"</em> whereas other devices instructed <em>"do not touch the patient"</em> which let to users no prompting the bystander letting go the manikin hand.
  outcome: Recommended changes in the device vocals instructions as well as helping designing instructions in the notice.<br>From a personal experience it has been a revelation that attention to details can sometimes be critical.
